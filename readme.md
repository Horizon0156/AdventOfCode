## Advent of Code 2021
My contributions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/)

Stick to the roots: Puzzles are solved using C# (scripts). Nevertheless, we are playing with newer features like `record` types, `with` expressions and more...

### How to run
Either install [.NET SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk) and the [dotnet-script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) tooling or check out the repository in a prepared devcontainer.

Afterwards you can simply run:
```
dotnet script Day1.csx
```
